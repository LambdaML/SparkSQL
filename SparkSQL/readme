To connect to the odbc database we need odbc driver which need to build with maven

Use the following command to build the odbc driver:
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=ojdbc14.jar -DgroupId=com.oracle -DartifactId=ojdbc14 -Dversion=10.2.0.2.0 -Dpackaging=jar


How to build the project

1)Download the SparkSQL Project and extract project

2) Run the maven install command to run the program

mvn clean install 

3)import the project in eclipse as maven project

4) Run the spark program :

You can run the spark using from eclipse directly by right click on program and click on java application 

or create the jar of the application 

5)Use the spark submit command to run the program in differnt deployment

Run the spark program in standalone mode : 

1) Goto the spark directory where spark folder is present

cd path_to_spark_folder/

e.g : cd /usr/local/spark-1.4.1

2) Execute the following command to run spark program

./bin/spark-submit --class com.spark.rdd.example.SparkWordCount --master local[4] SparkJar/WordCount.jar /user/hduser/README.md /user/hduser/WordCountOutput2

where 
--class : Name of the class that you want to execute(e.g : we specified full package name of class com.spark.rdd.example.SparkWordCount)
--master : deployment mode of spark.here we have specified deployment mode as local(possible value is yarn-client,yarn-master,local[4]
local[4] : How many thread core to be used for processing purpose.if number specified is more than number of core on machine spark will go with it own way
SparkJar/WordCount.jar : Name of the jar
/user/hduser/README.md : command line argument to the program
/user/hduser/WordCountOutput2 : command line argument to the program







./bin/spark-submit --class com.spark.rdd.example.SparkWordCount --master local[4] SparkJar/WordCount.jar /user/hduser/README.md /user/hduser/WordCountOutput2
